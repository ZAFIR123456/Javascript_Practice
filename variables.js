// Variables are an essential concept in programming, including JavaScript.
// They are used to store and represent data values that can change during the program's execution.
// Each variable has a name (identifier) and a value associated with it.

// In JavaScript, you can declare variables using the var, let, or const keywords:

// For example

// using var is the older way to declare a variable

var name = "ali";
var age = 28;

// using var you can also update value of 'name'

var name = "ahmed";

// console.log(name, age)
// using let is the new way to declare a variable

let score = 100;
let playerName = "Alice";

// using let you can also update value of 'score'

score = 200;
// console.log(score, playerName)

// using const is for constant

const pi = 3.14;

// pi = 3.14159; using const you cannot change the value of pi it will givean error
